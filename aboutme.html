        Degree/Career Path
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am returning to school to complete a degree I should have completed
        years ago. I started my family while in school and I left to pursue a
        career to support my family. I am now returning to complete a degree I
        wish I had completed years ago. I studied Computer Science in the past,
        but here I will be working on a degree in Applied Technology, Web
        Development.

      <p>
        My family is my greatest joy. I have been married for more than 40
        years. We have 5 children, one of which passed away as a yourg adult. I
        have 2 special needs children and my youngest son recently graduated
        from BYUi with a degree in Chemistry.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Things I Love to Do
      </h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy backpacking and have hiked all over the US, including sections
        of the Appalachian Trail in almost every state. I also enjoy chess and
        singing. I was once president of the BYU chess club and I performed with
        the Dallas Opera for 6 seasons.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Church Membership
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have been a member all my life. I served a Spanish speaking mission to
        Southern California. I have served many years as a Scoutmaster and twice
        as a bishop.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Expectations
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am taking this course to finish my degree. I already have some
        experience in this subject, but I am sure there will be things I can
        learn, and I look forward to it. I plan to use this course to enhance
        the knowledge I already have. I expect to fill any gaps I have in my
        knowledge about this area of IT. I look forward to learning a lot in
        this class. From my teacher as well as from my classmates.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Other
      </h3>

        I have a great-grandfather who taught blacksmithing at the Brigham Young
        Academy.
