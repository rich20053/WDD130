          <h2 class="northern-headline-1">Ft. Wayne</h2>
          <p class="northern-paragraph-1">
            Ft. Wayne is one of the oldest cities in the state. It was established by Revolutionary War General Anthony Wayne in 1784. It is a great city with lots to see. Some fun stops around Ft. Wayne include DeBrand Fine Chocolates and Sechlers Pickles. Both factories offer tasty tours.</p>

          <h2 class="northern-headline-2">Ft. Wayne Area State Parks</h2>
          <p class="northern-paragraph-2">
            Ouabache State Park is a beautiful state park just south of Ft. Wayne. It has a special feature. Visitors can see a small herd of American bison. North of Ft. Wayne is Pokagon State Park. Another beautiful state park with many fine facilities for camping and other activities. Pokagon is a favorite place from Thanksgiving to February due to their artificially cooled toboggan run.</p>

          <h2 class="northern-headline-3">Amish Country</h2>
          <p class="northern-paragraph-3">
            Northern Indiana is also the home to many Amish communities and their beautiful culture. Check out Shipshewana, Goshen, or Nappanee. Chain Oâ€™ Lakes State Park is nearby these lovely communities. This is a beautiful area with camping and fishing in series of connected lakes. Potato Creek State park offers much the same, but with a larger lake and property. It is a newer park with lots of hiking and biking trails.</p>

          <h2 class="northern-headline-4">South Bend / Indiana Dunes</h2>
          <p class="northern-paragraph-4">
            South Bend is home of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Studebaker Museum. A little to the east is the RV/MH Hall of Fame and museum. The gem of Indiana is Indiana Dunes, located along the southeastern shore of Lake Michigan. Indiana Dunes can be enjoyed as part of the Indiana Dunes National Park and the Indiana Dunes State Park.</p>
