      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How much do you know about the state of Indiana?  It may not have some of the majestic sites as Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon, but Indiana is a beautiful state that has a lot to offer.  I am going to create a website about beautiful and interesting sites in Indiana.  The site will start by dividing the state into north and south of Indiana and will focus on outdoor activities. It will include visits to Indiana State Parks and many points of interest around the state.  People who visit this website will enjoy seeing photos of the sites and reading about the many adventures they can expect to enjoy there.  They will learn about Marengo Cave, Indiana Dunes National Park, Lincon's Boyhood home, Rose Island, and many more! This site will help people plan their own road trip adventures and enjoy the natural, historical, and cultural wonders of the state of Indiana.  Give this site and Indiana a try, you’ll love them both! </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for this website includes a wide variety of people. It may be anyone who has an interest in Indiana or is passing through Indiana. It may be anyone who likes road trips, travel, or being in the outdoors. It may also be for anyone who wants to know more about the natural, cultural, or historical aspects of Indiana. Indiana is a small, midwestern state. Most people in the United States do not know much about it. This site is for people who want to know more or who want to be better informed whether they live in Indiana or not.</p>

        Typography
      </h3>

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Rockwell
      </h4>
      <p>
        This is a slab serif font.  It should create a solid foundational look and 
        contrast nicely with the sans serif paragraph font.  I am using a hardman font in my logo.
        It does not read well when it is smaller.  I may try to use it in special situations, but it will not be my standard heading font.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Myriad Pro
      </h4>
      <p>
        This is a sans serif font that will be easy to read and contrast well with the heading slab serif or decorative font.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        Marvelous sites to see! Opportunities to explore the natural, cultural, and historical wonder that is... Indiana!

      <h4>Northern Indiana</h4>      
      <p>The majority of northern Indiana is farmland. It is beautiful country, and it is generally flatter, but higher elevation than southern Indiana.  
        It is filled with gorgeous countryside and interesting sights.</p>
      
      <h4>Southern Indiana</h4>
      <p> Southern Indiana has some farmland, but the further south you go, the more rugged the country gets. It is also filled with wonderful sights.</p>

      <h3>Northern Indidana</h3>
            
      <h4>Ft. Wayne</h4>
      
      <p>Ft. Wayne is one of the oldest cities in the state. It was established by Revolutionary War General Anthony Wayne in 1784. It is a great city with lots to see. Some fun stops around Ft. Wayne include DeBrand Fine Chocolates and Sechlers Pickles. Both factories offer tasty tours.</p>
      
      <h4>Ft. Wayne Area State Parks</h4>
      
      <p>Ouabache State Park is a beautiful state park just south of Ft. Wayne. It has a special feature. Visitors can see a small herd of American bison. North of Ft. Wayne is Pokagon State Park. Another beautiful state park with many fine facilities for camping and other activities. Pokagon is a favorite place from Thanksgiving to February due to their artificially cooled toboggan run.</p>  
      
      <h4>Amish Country</h4>
      
      <p>Northern Indiana is also the home to many Amish communities and their beautiful culture. Check out Shipshewana, Goshen, or Nappanee. Chain O’ Lakes State Park is nearby the lovely communities. This is a beautiful area with camping and fishing in series of connected lakes. Potato Creek State park offers much the same, but with a larger lake and property. It is a newer park with lots of hiking and biking trails.</p>  

      <h4>South Bend/Indiana Dunes</h4>

      <p>South Bend is home of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Studebaker Museum. A little to the east is the RV/MH Hall of Fame and museum. The gem of Indiana is Indiana Dunes, located along the southeastern shore of Lake Michigan. Indiana Dunes can be enjoyed as part of the Indiana Dunes National Park and the Indiana Dunes State Park.</p>

      <h4>Fun Stops</h4>
      
      <p>If you travel down I65 from Indianapolis, you will find yourself in Columbus, Indiana. Columbus is the home of Cummins engines.  You can       enjoy their small museum as well as some very interesting architecture throughout the town.  Enjoy a real old-fashioned soda fountain and         calliope in Zaharako’s downtown.  Across the street, your children will enjoy the wonderful multi-story indoor play area in the Commons.</p>  
 
      <h4>Southern State Parks</h4>

      <p>Clifty Falls State Park is filled with natural beauty and great trails as well as a nice inn. Charlestown State Park is a former federal munition manufacturing site with boat ramp access to the Ohio River. A wonderful trail here takes you among the ruins of Rose Island, a former, riverside amusement park destroyed by a massive flood in 1937.</p>

      <h4>Natural Wonders</h4>
      
      <p>Marengo Cave, a natural wonder with easy cave tours, has cave tours where the visitor can crawl using a headlamp. Hemlock Cliffs National Scenic Trail is exciting, as you hike and negotiate interesting obstacles. Jug Rock is the largest rock formation in the state. Spring Mill State Park trails lead to creeks that appear to come out of rocks and an historic village that shows life in the 19th century.</p>
      
      <h4>Naional History</h4>
      
      <p>Lincoln Pioneer Village is a restoration of a town in Lincoln’s day. There are log cabins and a nice museum. Lincoln State Park has historical sites and trails Lincoln must have taken. Lincoln Boyhood National Historical Park occupies a portion of the Lincoln family 100-acre farm. The cabin is no longer standing; a foundation replica shows where it stood.</p>
